        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
            <li><span class="linethrough">Css is not neccesary </span><span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It an control the  layout of multiple webpages all at once.</li>
            <li><span class="underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External-by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However ,<span class="bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internlstyles.</span>because this easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="p">
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies to multiple elements ID, on the other hand applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a speial URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        
        <p>In CSS selectors are used tp target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        
        <p>There is a wide range of selection available.Two of the most coomonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
